# Code Mastery
*Master code, one quiz at a time.*

## Project Overview
**Code Mastery** is a Django-based AI quiz platform where students can generate, take, and share quizzes. The platform supports:

- AI-generated quizzes from prompts  
- Random quizzes via the randome/dice button  
- Manual quiz creation (CRUD)  
- Public quiz sharing via unique links  
- Progress tracking: points, streaks, badges  
- Gamified dashboard for registered users  

> Currently in early development.  

## Project Board
The development and feature tracking are organized in the [Code Mastery Mission Control](https://github.com/users/tigerpadla/projects/8) Kanban board.

## AI Reflection
GitHub Copilot was used to provide suggestions for some user stories, which were then reviewed and adjusted to fit the project’s specific goals.
